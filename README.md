![Compression Sample](https://github.com/binarydoor/PCA-Compression/raw/master/compression_sample.png)

PCA-Compression uses Principal Component Analysis machine learning algorithm to demontrate the efficient way generate
the ideal image and provide compressions.

Files:
* MNIST3.csv - Training data. Includes pixel values for 400 images
* compression.py - Python sourcecodes to import MNIST3.csv, calculate prediction image based on training data, and display results with different parameter range
* compression_sample.png - Screenshot of generated image


# Requirement

* Python 3.6
* Gray scaled image as 1D vector(s) in CVS file
